# Rental System Management System

A full‑stack **system management platform** built with **Next.js**. Rental System Management System is designed to manage users, records, and operational workflows efficiently with a modern, scalable, and developer‑friendly architecture.

> ⚡ Built with performance, scalability, and real‑world system management use‑cases in mind.

---

# 🚀 Overview

The **Rental System Management System** is a **landlord–tenant communication and management platform** built to streamline interaction, integrity, transparency, and operational control between **property owners (landlords)** and **tenants**.

At its core, Rental System Management System enables **secure communication**, **structured record management**, and **administrative oversight**, while still supporting all general system management features such as authentication, dashboards, and data control.

The platform is designed to reduce friction in rental management by centralizing:

* Communication between landlords and tenants
* Property-related updates and notices
* Tenant records and system data

It follows modern full-stack best practices using **Next.js App Router**, **API routes**, and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**.

# DISCLAIMER ⚠️⚠️
## Authentication in this system is about access control, not user discovery.

 
## HOW IT WORKS 
### 🔐 Getting Started (Admin → Tenant Flow)

1. **Log in as Admin**
   - Use the admin credentials provided during setup.
   - This gives you access to the main dashboard.
    ________________________
     ADMIN ID: Arnoldk       
     PASSCODE: qwertyuiop   
   __________________________

2. **Create a Tenant**
   - From the admin dashboard, create a tenant by assigning:
     - Room number  
     - Login credentials
   - Save the tenant details.

3. **Log in as Tenant**
   - Log out from the admin account.
   - Log in using the tenant credentials you just created.
   - The tenant can now access their dashboard and interact with the system.

> ℹ️ Note: Tenant accounts cannot self-register. All tenant credentials are created and managed by the admin.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Next.js** (App Router) | **Next.js API Routes** | **MongoDB** | Git & GitHub |
| **TypeScript & JavaScript** | **Node.js** runtime | **Mongoose** ODM | Environment variables (`.env`) |
| **React** | **Mongoose** ODM | **Prisma** ORM | ESLint |

## 🔗 Database Connection (Mongoose)

The system uses a **single reusable MongoDB connection** to prevent multiple connections during hot reloads in development.

Key points:

* Connection handled in `lib/db.ts`
* Cached connection for performance
* Uses environment variables for security

---

## 🧩 Models

Each MongoDB collection is defined using a **Mongoose schema**.

Example:

* User Model
* Role‑based fields
* Timestamps enabled

Models are reusable across API routes and server actions.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
ADMIN_ID=your_admin_id
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` to GitHub.
